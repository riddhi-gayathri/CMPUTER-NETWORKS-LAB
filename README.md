Programs and implementation of data structures in java (as per JSSTU syllabus)

PART A
1 A. Use appropriate tool to find Host name, IP address, physical address, 
subnet mask, default gateway etc [hint: Ipconfig]. Explore different options 
available with the tool. 
B. On the host system, identify the TCP connections, ports on which the 
computer is listening, Ethernet statistics, the IP routing table, 
IPV4statistics, and IPV4 statistics etc. using appropriate tool [hint: netstat]. 
Explore different options available with the tool.  

2 Write a program to sort frames using appropriate sorting techniques 

3 Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits). 

4 Write a program to find the shortest path between vertices using bellman
ford algorithm. 

5 Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client – server program to make the client 
send the file name and to make the server send back the contents of the 
requested file if present 

6 Write a program on datagram socket for client/server to display the 
messages on client side, typed at the server side. 

7 Write a program for simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data. 

8 Write a program for congestion control using leaky bucket algorithm and 
token bucket algorithm. 

9 Write a program to implement random early detection (RED) congestion 
control algorithm. 


PART-B: Simulation Experiments using NS2/ NS3/ NetSim or any other 
suitable simulation software 
 
10 Implement three nodes point – to – point network with duplex links 
between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth and find the number 
of packets dropped. 

11 Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network 
topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due 
to congestion 

12 Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes 
and plot congestion window for different source / destination. 

13 Implement simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in wire-less LAN by 
simulation and determine the performance with respect to transmission of 
packets
